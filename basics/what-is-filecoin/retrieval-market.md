# Retrieval market

## Basic retrieval

Currently, Filecoin nodes support direct retrieval from the storage miners who originally stored the data. Clients can send retrieval requests directly to a storage provider and pay a small amount of FIL to retrieve their data.

To request data retrieval, clients need to provide the following information to the storage provider:

- **Storage Provider ID**: The ID of the storage provider where the data is stored.
- **Payload CID**: Also known as Data CID.
- **Address**: The address initially used to create the storage deal.
