# Chat and discussion forums

### Chat

For shorter-lived discussions, our community chat open to all on both Slack and Matrix, with bridged channels allowing you to participate in the same conversations from either platform:

* [Slack](https://filecoin.io/slack/)
* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ipfs-space:ipfs.io)

### Discussion Forums

For long-lived discussions and for support, please use the [discussion tab on GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community#forums) instead of Slack or Matrix. Itâ€™s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on those chat platforms, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums helps future visitors, too.
