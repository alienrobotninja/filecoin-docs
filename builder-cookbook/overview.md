# Overview

The Builder Cookbook is designed to help builders quickly discover and learn the specific features required to develop robust solutions on Filecoin.&#x20;

This comprehensive collection of straightforward recipes serves as a practical guide, showcasing the usage and best practices of core features on Filecoin, enabled by the [Filecoin Virtual Machine(FVM)](../smart-contracts/fundamentals/the-fvm.md).

### **How to use this cookbook?**

*   **Ingredients**

    a set of the necessary tools, libraries, or dependencies required for this recipe might need to be installed in advance.
